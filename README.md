**ECG Classification with Wavelet Transform and Deep Neural Networks**

I worked on a MATLAB-based project with the aim of advancing the classification of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, a development that holds significant implications for real-life applications. Here's a breakdown of the key components and the project's importance:

Overview:

**Signal Processing Integration:**

*Developed an ECG signal classification system utilizing MATLAB.
Integrated Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for in-depth signal analysis, enhancing the system's ability to extract meaningful features from ECG signals.*

**Deep Learning with Transfer Learning:**

*Implemented transfer learning by fine-tuning a pre-trained AlexNet model.*

**DNN Training and Classification:**

*Trained a Deep Neural Network (DNN) using a carefully pre-processed ECG dataset.
Achieved an outstanding classification accuracy of 96%, showcasing the system's effectiveness in categorizing distinct heartbeats.*

**Real-Life Significance:**

Clinical Diagnosis Enhancement: The project contributes to improving clinical diagnosis accuracy, enabling healthcare professionals to identify potential cardiac abnormalities with greater confidence.

Early Detection of Cardiac Conditions: The high accuracy achieved facilitates early detection of cardiac conditions, a crucial factor in effective disease management and prevention.

Cost-Effective Screening: The automated ECG classification streamlines the screening process, making it more cost-effective and accessible, particularly in resource-limited settings.
